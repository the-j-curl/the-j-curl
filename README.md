### Hi there, I'm Jamie ðŸ‘‹

#### Frontend developer with a view on going full-stack - living in Sweden

In August I joined the Technigo coding boot camp: A 24-week fast-paced remote boot-camp and I graduate in February 2021. I previously worked as a web management assistant and wanted to increase my knowledge of development. I like to write clean, well structured code and I love learning new things. Here are some fun facts about me:

* I am currently working on my web development skills: **JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB and Node.js**.
* I have over 8 years experience working in **IT service management** and 1 year working in **web management** 
* **Personal development** is important to me
* Previously I worked in **tech support** and I enjoy troubleshooting problems
* My favourite stack is: **React** ðŸ’¥
* I like to share my coding projects on my **[Portfolio - Jamie Cook](https://jamiecook.netlify.app/)**
