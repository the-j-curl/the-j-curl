### Hi there, I'm Jamie ðŸ‘‹

#### Frontend developer with a view on going full-stack - living in Sweden

In August I joined the Technigo coding boot camp: A 24-week fast-paced remote boot-camp and graduate in February 2021. I previously worked as a web management assistant and wanted to increase my knowledge of development. I like to write clean, well structured code and I love learning new things. Here are some fun facts about me:

* I am currently working on my web development skills: JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB and Node.js.
* I have over 8 years experience working in IT and 1 year working in web management 
* Personal development is important to me
* Previously I have worked in tech support and I like to troubleshoot
* My favourite stack is: React ðŸ’¥
* I like to share my coding projects on my [portfolio - Jamie Cook](https://jamiecook.netlify.app/)
* Contact me on [LinkedIn - Jamie Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiepcook)
